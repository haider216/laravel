            <div class="text-base font-bold ">
                As a Phaleristic non-profit organization, we shall be transparent in all our activities. It is the policy of the International Phaleristics Association (IPA) to conduct its organization according to the highest ethics. All members are expected to act with integrity when dealing with government agencies, other organizations, sponsors and donors, suppliers, fellow members, and the general public.
                The International Phaleristics Association will conduct its affairs decently and above reproach and will operate with the highest level of integrity and avoid conflicts of interest.
                Between the organization, Board of Directors, staff, and volunteers there exists a fiduciary duty that carries with it a broad and unbending duty of loyalty. The Board of Directors, staff, and volunteers have the responsibility to administer the affairs of IPA honestly and prudently, and to exercise their best care, skill and judgment for the sole benefit of transactions involved in their duties, and they shall not use their positions with the organization or knowledge gained therefrom for their personal benefit. The interests of IPA must have the first priority, and all purchases of goods and services must be affected on a basis that secures for IPA full competitive advantage as to product, service and price.

                “Disclosure” shall mean providing properly, to the appropriate person, a written description of the facts comprising the real or apparent conflict of interest. An annual disclosure statement shall be circulated to Trustees, Officers, Staff, Volunteers,  and Agents of IPA to assist them in considering such disclosures, but disclosure is appropriate and required whenever conflicts of interest may occur. The written notices of disclosure shall be filed with the President. At the annual board meeting at the Annual Membership meeting, all disclosures of real or apparent conflict of interest shall be noted, for the record, in the minutes.<br></br>
                An individual Trustee, Officer, Staff, Volunteer, or Agent of IPA who believes that he or she or an immediate member of his or her immediate family might have a real or apparent conflict of interest, in addition to filing a notice of disclosure, must abstain from:<br></br>
                1.	Participating in discussions or deliberations with respect to the subject of the conflict (other than to provide factual information or to answer questions.)<br></br>

                A Single Medal Led to Some Interesting Research<br></br>
                Michael B. Riley<br></br>
                I recently purchased a Soviet Gramota (Certificate of Merit/Gratitude of the State)
                (Figure 1) and a Medal for the Liberation of Prague (Figure 2 & 3).<br></br>
                Figure 1 Gramote for Service in the Liberation of Prague<br></br>
                Figure 2 Obverse of the Medal for the Liberation of Prague<br></br>
                Figure 3 Reverse of the Medal for the Liberation of Prague<br></br>
                The Medal for the Liberation of Prague was established on 9 June 1945 for participation
                in the Liberation of Prague, Czechoslovakia between 3 May 1945 and 9 May 1945.<br></br>
                The medal is a circular, 32mm diameter, brass disc. The Obverse, only, has a raised
                rim. The obverse has a five-pointed star at the bottom center of the medal. There is a
                laurel wreath extending from both sides of the star to the 4 O’clock and 8 O’clock
                positions. Above the star is the sun rising with nine (9) rays extending outward. The
                upper half of the medal consists of the Russian words “For the Liberation of” ЗА
                ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЕ along the rim and the Russian word for “Prague” ПРАГИ centered
                in a straight line. The reverse has a five-pointed star centered at the base of the
                medallion. Above this, in three (3) lines is the Russian date 9 May 1945 (9 МАЯ 1945).<br></br>
                While the medal yields no research potential, The Gramota does. I asked Soviet
                researcher, Igor Korenev, to translate the Gramota. He Identified the recipient as Senior
                Lieutenant (Sr. Lt.) Sofia Moiseevna Eskina-Doubman of the Medical Corps. I love
                awards to Soviet medical personnel, so I had to know more. I asked Igor to get me her
                Award Record Card (ARC)(Figure 4 & 5) which gives her biographical information on
                the front and lists the awards she earned on the back, Citations (Figure ), and Officer’s
                Service Record (Figure ).<br></br>
                Figure 4 Award Record Card (ARC) Front<br></br>
                Figure 5 Award Record Card (ARC) Back<br></br>
                The ARC showed that she earned the Order of the Patriotic War, II Class #762028,
                Order of the Red Star #720322, and the Medal for Combat Merits #1192000. The ARC
                shows the following biographical information:<br></br>
                Senior Lieutenant Doubman is Jewish and was born in 1920 in the Ukrainian Soviet
                Socialist Republic Town of Zhitomir (Figure 6 & 7).<br></br>

                Figure 7 Map Showing the Location of Zhitomir, Ukraine<br></br>
                Sr. Lt. Doubman served as a Regimental Doctor from August 1942 to November 1945.<br></br>
                She was drafted by the Buzuluk District Military Commissariat, Chkalov Region.<br></br>
